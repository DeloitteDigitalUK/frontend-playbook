## About us page

### Our Work
We are more than just a bunch of developers at Deloitte Digital London. We are a full service consulting agency that brings together a blend of all things digital. Drawing from a breadth of backgrounds from our creative and technology capabilities, strategy, analytics, and industry knowledge. We provide a dash of everything that is needed to help transform our clients’ businesses. With our end-to-end capabilities there is no project too small, clients can trust us with their biggest challenges, knowing we’ve got what it takes to bring a new business vision to life.

Take our work with John Lewis for example. We worked closely with John Lewis’s to upturn their commerce offering making it not just market leading, but market beating. John Lewis has an eCommerce offering that sets the benchmark for customer experience and proposition, embarking on a Retail Revolution with the goal of becoming ‘Britain’s leading retailer’ with the market beating Omni-Channel Proposition.

### Our culture
Culture
Whilst sharing the Deloitte professional values, we bring our own distinct culture. We embrace our technical and artistic backgrounds, leveraging this diversity as a strength. Working together seamlessly to deliver differentiating solutions that bring creative flare in equal measure to technical achievement.

We foster a strong sense of community, both within engagement teams and across our studios combined. We come together regularly, learning and sharing as one in addition to having fun and recognising accomplishments.
