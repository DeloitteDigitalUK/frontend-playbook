Organize your UI libraries in small elements, then work your way out toward larger components, and then layouts. While doing that, always be explicit about all objects’ associated types, variants and states. 

*Visual inventory* helps to decide on visual direction without spending too much  time on “deadlift” mock-ups.

Project hub is one central, shared place with one URL, with all important assets sorted chronologically.

*Pattern library* establishes  a shared design vocabulary;  it enhances consistency and maintainability of a project.

## Establishing Modularity
### Vocabulary 
* Discover and define a shared **vocabulary** for modules.
* Make the vocabulary part of everyday culture.

**Vocabulary example**
*Form*: intros, outros, core, heros, bridges, helpers.  
*Structure*: base, layout, module, state, theme.

### Grammar 
* Identify simple **rules** on how parts fit together.
* The language is refined during prototyping.

**Rules Example**  
*Vertical spacing for a module is always proportional to the line-height of the base font size.*  
*Bridges always appear between two modules.*  
*Helpers never appear after bridges.*  
*Horizontal spacing between modules is always two columns (+ gutter) within the responsive grid.*  

### Language 
* Design as assembly of flexible, distinct modules.
* Pattern library embodies the design language.

If you have to do extra work to update your style guide when making changes to your look and feel, the likelihood of it staying up to date is pretty slim.

## Maintaining Modularity

### Low-fidelity hand-offs
Visual tools still used for visual direction  
hand-offs can be as simple as hand-drawn sketches.

### Pattern library first
New modules are *first added to the PL*, then deployed. One-stop place for the entire team.

### Ownership lies within the team  
No “style guide master”. Integrate PL into the workflow.
