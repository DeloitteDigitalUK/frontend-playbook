#API Mocks
##Overview
When we work on a project we will often have a dependency on the back-end team/external team to provide us with necessary information via APIs. Unfortunately, it might not always be possible to access the API due to various reasons: security, performance or the functionality might not have been developed yet.

This is where mocks come to the rescue: rather than relying on something else to provide us with the required information, we will create a mock of the information and use that instead. This will enables us to move forward without being hindered by possible unavailability of external systems we depend on.
