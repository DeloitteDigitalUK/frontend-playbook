# Responsive Patterns

## Navigation

#### Mobile menu

when the menu doesn’t fit, conceal it.

Example: [Lidl](http://www.lidl.co.uk)

#### Off-canvas menu
menu appears from a side and pushes all of the content

Example: [Style](http://www.style.com), [Hunter](http://www.hunterboots.com)

#### Conditionally loaded menus
some menu items are hidden on smaller screens

#### Progressive disclosure

#### Hamburger icon animations

#### Hamburger icon issues

Designer James Foster ran a thorough [usability study](http://sitesforprofit.com/mobile-menu-abtest) on a large site’s responsive navigation, and found that the word “Menu” consistently outperformed the icon alone, with a 12.9% higher conversion rate.


However, time.com are using it successfully. UX team at Booking.com recently [surveyed their users](https://blog.booking.com/hamburger-menu.html) and found the hamburger icon worked just fine for their site and its audience.

UI element, pattern, or feature is never tested in isolation. It is tested against a very specific user base in a very specific scenario. What works for Booking.com may not work for you and your users. This is the reason we A/B test in the first place, because the findings of other are all unproven until they’ve been tested against our customers, on our platform.

Every responsive navigation system can be problematic. Use A/B tests to verify if it works for your users.


#### Hidden drawers issue

The designers of Beamly’s native app [discovered](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/04/08/ux-designers-side-drawer-navigation-costing-half-user-engagement/) that ditching hideable drawers in favour of always-visible navigation dramatically improved user engagement and satisfaction. "Side drawer navigation could be costing you half your user engagement”.

In discussing common design issues in apps for iOS, Mike Stern, a user experience evangelist at Apple, covered a [number of the issues](http://blog.manbolo.com/2014/06/30/apple-on-hamburger-menus) with hidden navigation drawers.

**You have to prioritise**.

Drawers of any kind have a nasty tendency to fill with junk. We should use small screens as a lens through which we view every aspect of our designs, including navigation.
