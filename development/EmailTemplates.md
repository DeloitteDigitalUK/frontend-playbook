## Email templates

### RTFM
The best resource to consult if you need to write email templates is the [Mailchimp Developers Guide](https://templates.mailchimp.com).

Specifically, these sections

* [CSS](https://templates.mailchimp.com/development/css/)
* [HTML](https://templates.mailchimp.com/development/html/)
* [Responsive emails](https://templates.mailchimp.com/development/responsive-email/)
* [Testing](https://templates.mailchimp.com/development/testing-emails/)

### Getting started
Good starting for responsive HTML templates that just work:  
* [Foundation for Emails](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html)

### Third-party testing
* [Litmus](http://www.litmus.com)
* [Inbox inspector](https://mailchimp.com/features/inbox-preview)
