# Static Typing

## Why use static typing in JS?

- **Catch errors earlier**.  
  It's better for the compiler to catch errors than to have things fail at runtime.
  
- **Types are one of the best forms of documentation you can have.**  
  The function signature is a theorem and the function body is the proof.
